#Estimate the simplest model, one with only a term for tie density (akin to an intercept term in a glm):
m1 = ergm(n ~ edges)
summary(m1)

#The edges output represents exactly the density of the ties in out network
# check that here
all.equal(network.density(n), plogis(coef(m1)[[1]]))

##Now letâ€™s make things more interesting and estimate a term for reciprocity of ties. 
#That is, given an i -> j tie, what is the change in log-odds likelihood of a j -> i tie? 
#The coefficient estimate on 'mutual' tells us exactly that:

m2 = ergm(n ~ edges + mutual)
summary(m2)

#Now interpret these coefficients 
#this is the baseline probability of a tie
plogis(coef(m2)[['edges']])

##But if you look at the 'mutual' estimate, we can see that the log odds of a tie is 2.3
## times greater if the reciprocal tie is present

## translate this into a probability so we can interpret it
plogis(coef(m2)[['edges']] + coef(m2)[['mutual']])


# we can see now that there is a 64 chance of a tie if the reciprocal tie is present
## compare this to the baseline of 15% <- rember we got this from plogis(coef(m2)[['edges']])

##Before we start writing up our submission to Science though, 
##we need to check two things: 
##1) that the MCMC routine behaved well (that our estimates are likely good approximations of the MLEs), 
#and 2) that our model fits the data well. statnet has functions to do both those things.

##this ^^ checks our model estimates, now lets see if they fit our data
## gof simulates networks from the ERGM estimates and, for some set of network statistics, 
#compares the distribution in the simulated networks to the observed values.

#this will simulate networks based on our network statistics and compare them to our 
#observed network. For this, the higher the p-value the better
